[![Update data.json](https://github.com/sffxzzp/SteamChineseChecker/actions/workflows/update-data.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sffxzzp/SteamChineseChecker/actions/workflows/update-data.yml)

Inspired by this [post](https://keylol.com/t503313-1-1).

This is a userscript that displays if a game has 3rd party Chinese patch, all data collected from steam curator [华语汉化](https://store.steampowered.com/curator/31318556/).

File `data.json` is now auto build by Github Actions, and will automaticly update each week.
