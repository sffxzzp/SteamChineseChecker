# SteamChineseChecker
Inspired by this [thread](https://steamcn.com/t503313-1-1).

This is a userscript that displays if a game has 3rd party Chinese patch, all data from curator [华语汉化](https://store.steampowered.com/curator/31318556/)

The `data.json` is now auto build by travis-ci, and will update each week if any updates.
